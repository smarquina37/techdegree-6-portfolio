# techdegree-6-portfolio

In this project, I built a portfolio site to showcase the the projects I have completed in my Treehouse learning journey using "server-side" JavaScript. I created a JSON file to store all the data for my projects. I used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser. Through building this project, I learned and utilized Node.js, Express and Pug, how to set up a server, how to handle requests, and built a powerful and modern back end project.

For extra credit, I changed the border and border radius around my photo, changed the font in my body headers/paragraphs, and changed the font color of some of my sidebar titles and links.
